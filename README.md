## Slot Machine Game
A slot machine is the machine you can see in many casinos where people insert a coin and then there are three wheels spinning with some fruits or symbols inside. In this case, we cannot enter coins

The behaviour will be as follows:

The machine has 3 wheels.Each wheel has 4 symbols (strawberry, banana, orange and a monkey). Do not overdo the design. In our case, the machine can show only one symbol per wheel.

The machine starts with the symbols in some random position

The machine has a start button. When the user presses it, then the wheels spin (a symbol every, 50ms)

If the user doesn’t press start, then the machine does it automatically after 5 seconds

If the user doesn’t press stop, the machine stops automatically after 10 seconds (after starting)

The machine has a stop button. When the user presses it, then the wheels stop. If all the wheels show the two or more symbols of the same type, then we have a prize!!!. Two identical non-consecutive symbols, the prize is 10 dollars, Two consecutive symbols, then the prize is 20 dollars. The same symbol in all the wheels, the prize is 100 dollars
